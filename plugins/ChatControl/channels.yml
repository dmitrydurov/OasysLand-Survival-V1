#                  Welcome to ChatControl's channel configuration
#
#   In this configuration you can setup chatting rooms on your server, also known as
#   chat channels.
#
#   Chat channels can reduce spam on big servers because they sort players to individual
#   channels instead of letting everyone to chat on the main server chat.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Should the channel functionality be enabled?
#
# When you enable this, we disable standard formatting completely (we will ignore Enabled
# option in formatting.yml and acts as if it was on false). However, admin chat and bungee
# chat will still be functional and use format in formatting.yml since those are
# independent of channels.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enabled: false

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Put players with the autojoin permission automatically into channels?
# 
# Give them chatcontrol.channel.autojoin.{channel}.{mode} permission to make this feature
# function. Replace {channel} with the channel name and {mode} with channel mode (read,
# write, spy)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto_Join: true

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If you join a channel into write mode, your old channels are automatically changed
# to reading mode. Set this flag to true if you want old channels change to spying instead.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switch_To_Spy: false

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When you leave your writing channel should we try to turn your first reading channel
# into writing for your convenience?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto_Write_On_Leave: true

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What commands should trigger the channel menu (separated by a comma ,)? 
# 
# * THE FIRST ALIAS IS THE MAIN LABEL, PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE IT. *
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command_Aliases:
- 'channel'
- 'ch'

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Send "You are in X channel." / "You have no channels" messages to players when they join?
#
# You can change the message in the localization (see settings.yml)
#
# TIP: To hide "Player X have joined this channel", hide it in the localization as well!
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notify_On_Join: true

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How many channels can the player be at once, maximum?
#
# You can override this and give VIP's/staff more channels, see Groups in settings.yml.
# PS: There is no limit for spying channels.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Channel_Limits:
  Write: 1
  #
  # Limit for channels which the player can read.
  #
  Read: 3

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When you use /channel send command must the player be in the given channel for them
# to be able to use that command? False by default
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Send_Command_Require_Join: false

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Since you can be in more then one channel at once, some third party plugins
# do not like this idea and ChatControl needs to be adjusted.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compatibility:
  #
  # Should we fire Player Chat Event for each channel where the player writes separately?
  # 
  # Each plugin will get each message from each channel separately to process
  # multiple times in case of the single chat event that was fired originally.
  # 
  # Can conflict with NoCheatPlus and Factions or print doubled messages if not handled correctly.
  #
  Multi_Event: false
  #
  # If "Multi_Event" is "false", only one message will appear in the console and to other
  # plugins, no matter how many channels the player is in. Configure the format here.
  #
  # All variables are supported, however, no JSON can be added due to Bukkit limitations.
  # The special variable {channels} will print all channels the player is in.
  #
  Single_Event_Format: '[{channels}] {player}: {message}'
  #
  # ChatControl listens to "chat event" from which we process the channel message.
  # Cancel the event? Enable if you have for example Discord and see doubled messages.
  #
  Cancel_Event: false
  #
  # Settings for when you have DiscordSRV enabled.
  # TO USE DISCORD FOR CHANNELS, PLACE "Discord: true" KEY AND VALUE FOR THE CHANNELS
  # WHERE YOU WANT TO USE IT
  #
  Discord:
    #
    # If true, messages from Discord will be only send into a ChatControl channel
    # with exactly the same name, in the format below.
    #
    Control_Incoming_Messages: true
    #
    # If the option above is true, and channel is not installed on the server,
    # should be block the message from appearing in the chat? If not, DiscordSRV
    # will handle it and it will display to all players on your server.
    #
    Deny_Unknown_Channel: true
    #
    # When you are online both on Discord and in-game, apply your in-game formatting 
    # when you type from Discord? This will cause duplicated messages on Bungee, 
    # and it is therefore disabled by default.
    #
    Apply_Natural_Format_If_Online: false
    #
    # If you write a message on discord and you are NOT online under the same name,
    # the following format will be used. Specify full format or link in formatting.yml
    # If you are online, we will send it as though it was you from the server.
    #
    # Set to "" to use your channel's format, but this is not recommended
    # because we cannot replace variables since the player is not online!
    #
    Format: '&8[&3Discord&8] &7{player}: &f{message}'
