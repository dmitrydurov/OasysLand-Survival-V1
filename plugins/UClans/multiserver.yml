###### About multiserver mode #####
#
# The multiserver mode synchronizes user data at a high frequency, so if you don't use the 
#same database on multiple servers, leave this "false" to save memory.
#
# Remember, if you don't use multiserver mode, use different databases for each server.
# Holograms are not synchronized.
#Clan bases are not yet being separated
#
#About "servername": This needs to be a UNIQUE NAME, if you are using "mode" like BUNGEECORD, 
#it needs to have the same name in the instance of bungeecord..
#
#About "updateTask": This is the time in SECONDS between syncs, setting a value too high causes 
#sync delay and too low a value uses a lot of data traffic. so a suitable value is between 2 and 5
#
#About "mode": There are 2 synchronization switches:
# -- BUNGECORD: With this mode you need to install the UClans.jar plugin inside your
#plugins folder on the bungecord instance, and the synchronization is done through
#interaction channels without the use of databases.
#
# -- MYSQL: This mode is a little slower and demands higher server load when doing multiple
#queries and inserts into the database, if you don't have a bungecord network use with caution
#
# ATENTION: For both sync modes it is mandatory to use MYSQL database!
